# MLP for Approximate Low-thrust Transfers

In this repository, a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network is implemented for approximating optimal low-thrust transfers. The main reference for this project is [[1]](#1). The authors have shared the datasets that can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://data.niaid.nih.gov/resources?id=zenodo_10972837).
